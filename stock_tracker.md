## The Idea

Looking at my stocks everyday can be a tiresome and stressful act. To fix this, I wrote this code to summarize changes in my current portfolio and look into buying and selling stocks. This summary is sent to my email everyday after the stock market closes.

## Instructions
1. Copy the code
2. Input your specific portfolio and edit the email address so that it is yours
3. Run the code at the end of the day to get the summary
